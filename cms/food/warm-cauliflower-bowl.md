hat do you think about when you start planning your meals for the week? Do you go through your fridge and see what’s going to expire soon? Do you follow whatever flavor combination you’ve been craving? This roasted cauliflower bowl is the best of both worlds: There’s a little bit of every flavor in this recipe, and it’s very customizable.

I love big bowls of things. Period. Bonus points if there’s a lot of different things going on texture- and flavor-wise. This roasted cauliflower bowl is warm and a little bit spicy, and includes one of my favorite beans (chickpeas!). Plus, there’s feta. (There should always be feta.)
