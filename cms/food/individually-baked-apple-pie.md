ven with years of professional and home cooking experience, I still approach homemade pie with a bit of trepidation. I’ve said it [before](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/perfect-pumpkin-pie.html): the person who coined the term “easy as pie” had obviously never made a homemade pie! But making a delicious apple pie is totally doable as long as you have a tried and true recipe like this one. The key is to avoid the typical apple pie pitfalls — a soggy crust and waterlogged filling — by blind baking the crust and boiling down the juices before filling the pie.
