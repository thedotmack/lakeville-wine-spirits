“Where should we eat?” is a question we often get asked as Guest Concierges at The June, and while Google may lead you to a “5 Places You Should Grab A Bite in The County” article, a comprehensive list is dearly missing! Don’t fret, we’ve set out to compile everything you need to know about dining out or grabbing takeaway in beautiful and delicious Prince Edward County!

New(ish) to The County
======================

The County has long been known for its culinary scene, and more things are added by the year! These bright and shiny spots are relatively new The County and we’re pleased to welcome them with a special mention!

### [Beacon Bike & Brew\*](https://www.beaconbikebrew.com/)

Serving up lattes and delectable eats (their squash and avocado toasts are to dine for), Beacon Bike & Brew is a stylish addition to the already quaint Picton Main Street. Bike Shop meets Cafe meets Bar in a space well suited for catching up with a pal or working remotely (bonus: they have wifi). You can often find our Guest Concierges sipping away on an oat milk latte and noshing down on the best vegan muffins (who knew raisins could be so delicious?)! We highly recommend this friendly spot - and be sure to check out their social for updates on events & specials!
