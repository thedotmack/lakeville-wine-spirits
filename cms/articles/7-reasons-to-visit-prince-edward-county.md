1\. Experience the county like a local.
---------------------------------------

Summer is peak season here in Prince Edward - if you've visited [Sandbanks](https://www.ontarioparks.com/park/sandbanks) or attempted to drive the main street of Picton between Canada Day and Labour Day, you know this well! If fewer crowds and less traffic is your idea of the perfect mid-week or weekend getaway, autumn is the best time to experience the sights and the eats without waiting on a crowd!

2\. Empty Beaches
-----------------

That's right - hit the beach and get the perfect shot without a dozen other beach goers in the background! Spread out your blanket as much as you like and lounge in the quiet beauty of Lake Ontario and the Bay of Quinte!

3\. Dine & Stay Countylicious
-----------------------------

The County is a not-so-hidden culinary gem, and one of the best ways to experience the boutique accommodations and the quality farm to table delights of the county is with a [Dine & Stay Package](https://www.thejunemotel.com/packages)! The package includes one night at The June and dinner for two at [Bloomfield Public House](https://bloomfieldpublichouse.ca/) ($100 value) Tuesdays through Thursdays until October 31st!  

Looking for a late autumn culinary adventure? [Countylicious](http://www.countylicious.com/) happens November 1-24, 2019 and features a selection of restaurants that made the County the "gastronomic capital of Ontario" according to The Globe & Mail - pick your weekend and check [availability](https://secure.webrez.com/Bookings105/activity-edit.html?table=hotels&listing_id=2189&mode=command&command=website_availabilitycalendar&hotel_id=2189) at The June! What exactly is Countylicious? A set three-course menu at participating restaurants for a fixed price.

4\. Fall for Autumn.
--------------------

The leaves will be falling, and so will you - madly in love with the County colours. Autumn is a special treat in most places, but most places don't have the charm of the county. Sip wine amongst autumn leaves, or catch [Pumpkinfest](http://prince-edward-county.com/event/pumpkinfest/) surrounded by warm earthy hues!
