##### A

fter downtime following the release of his debut EP “Vicelove,” (Slaight Music/Warner Music Canada) in summer 2019, Sam and his band are coming to throw a champagne soaked party in celebration of the release of a new single dropping the same day. Promising to preview some additional new unreleased music, the night is set to be one out of a movie.“Make some noise. Build some family.” And you better believe there will be an after party. Much love.”
