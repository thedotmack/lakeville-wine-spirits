oin us for a complimentary Wine & Welcome at Kandy Gallery located on the ground floor of Hotel X Toronto, on Monday, January 27 from 6:00 pm - 9:00 pm.

Meet Canadian nature photographer Neil Dankoff, who was commissioned to bring nearly 800 works of fine art photography to Hotel X Toronto from his travels around the globe. A highlight of the evening will be a brand new exhibit featuring Neil's recent work.

All are welcome to stop by for a glass of wine while exploring this beautiful collection. There will be a book signing as well for those interested in purchasing a copy of Focal Points. Take a peek at some of Neil's beautiful work below!

The evening doesn't have to end there - head up to Falcon SkyBar following the event to enjoy a cocktail, featuring stunning views of Toronto's skyline.
